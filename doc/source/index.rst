Welcome to IR-SIM's documentation!
==================================

**Intelligent Robotics Simulation (IR-SIM)** is a Python based lightweight robotics simulator that provides a quite simple and easy-to-use interface for simulating various robot behaviors. The simulator is designed for research and educational purposes in the field of robotics. 

It provides the following features:
  - A versatile and easy-to-use framework for simulating a variety of robot platforms with kinematics and sensors. 
  - Customizable configurations and parameters using yaml files.
  - Real-time visualization of simulation outcomes.
  - Ideal for developing and testing algorithms related to robot navigation, motion planning, reinforcement learning.

The simple demonstrations of the simulator are shown below:
