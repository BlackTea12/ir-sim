Welcome to IR-SIM's documentation!
==================================

**IR-SIM** is an open-source, lightweight robot simulator based on Python, specifically designed for intelligent robotics navigation and learning. Primarily intended for research and educational purposes, it is user-friendly and easily customizable.

It provides the following features:

- **Versatile and User-Friendly Framework:** Simulate a wide range of robot platforms with diverse kinematics and sensors.
- **Easy Configuration with YAML:** Easily set up and modify simulation scenarios using straightforward YAML files, no complex coding required for quick and flexible environment customization.
- **Real-Time Visualization:** Visualize simulation outcomes in real time for immediate feedback and analysis.
- **Predefined Benchmark Behaviors:** Utilize a comprehensive library of pre-defined behaviors that serve as benchmarks for evaluating and comparing algorithm performance.
- **Ideal for Algorithm Development:** Suitable for developing and testing algorithms related to robot navigation, motion planning, optimal control, and reinforcement learning.

The simple demonstrations of the simulator are shown below:
